Chat Manager is a complex plugin that cant work by itself, the plugin has a few requirements before it can work on your server.

## Requirements
| Plugin         | Link                                                      |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Vault          | https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/           |
| LuckPerms      | https://luckperms.net/                                    |

**Information**
The plugin itself requires Vault and LuckPerms to run properly, without the plugin, ChatManager can easily break and send out a lot of errors in console. Vault is required to use the chat format feature correctly without causing any errors.

An in-depth reason for why you need Vault and LuckPerms, Please go on the chat format page [here](https://github.com/Crazy-Crew/ChatManager/wiki/Chat-Format).
