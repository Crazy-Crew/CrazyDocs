### Explanation:
This page helps explain how the chance system works in this plugin.

### How it works:
When using the chance system it uses a raffle type of system. The more tickets you have in the bukkit the higher chance of you getting picked.

### Example:
Layout: `- '<Chance> <Command goes after>'`

`- '45 eco give %Player% 100'`

`- '25 eco give %Player% 1000'`

`- '15 eco give %Player% 10000'`

`- '10 eco give %Player% 100000'`

`- '5 eco give %Player% 1000000'`

Each prize has it's own tickets(chance) of being picked out of the big bukkit of tickets.
