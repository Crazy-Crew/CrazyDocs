CrazyCrates v1.16 has added a proper API but currently no documentation on the limitations of said API. It only handles adding/fetching and removing keys at the moment. The documentation will be expanded on shortly however I did make an example plugin...

https://github.com/Crazy-Crew/ExamplePlugin -> An example of how to use the CrazyCrates API.
