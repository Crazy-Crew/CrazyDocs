### 1. Why can't my players auction off items?
#### They are lacking permissions, Using a plugin like LuckPerms to give out the following permissions.
#### Note: This can be used for both `sell` and `bid`
 * crazyauctions.<sell/bid>
 * crazyauctions.<sell/bid>.# ( Replace # with any number which defines how many items can be sold/bid for/on at a time )
