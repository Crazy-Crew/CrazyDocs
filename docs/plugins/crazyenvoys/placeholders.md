### 3rd Party Placeholders
_The first table assumes you are using [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) to parse placeholders._

Placeholder|Description
---|---
`%crazyenvoys_cooldown%`|`Shows the cooldown until the next envoy.`
`%crazyenvoys_time_left%`|`Shows how much time is left on the current envoy.`
`%crazyenvoys_crates_left%`|`Shows how many envoys are left.`
`%crazyenvoys_crates_time%`|`If crate count down is enabled. It shows how long until players can claim the envoy.`

### [MVdWPlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/11182/) *Only used for [Legacy Versions](https://modrinth.com/plugin/crazycrates/versions?g=1.8.8,1.12.2,1.16.5)*
Placeholder|Description
---|---
`{crazyenvoys_cooldown}`|`Shows the cooldown until the next envoy.`
`{crazyenvoys_time_left}`|`Shows how much time is left on the current envoy.`
`{crazyenvoys_crates_left}`|`Shows how many envoys are left.`

*MVdWPlaceholderAPI is needed for the placeholders to work.
