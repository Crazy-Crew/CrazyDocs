## Where are we moving our resources to?
All our resources will now be uploaded on Hangar and Modrinth, you can find links to our organizations below.

### What about CrazyVouchers being paid?
CrazyVouchers has been a free for a total of 2 years, Any purchase made on Spigot for CrazyVouchers was you simply supporting the Developers.

### What if I don't want to use Paper?
That sucks since Paper simply providers a better experience with plugins and for server performance, however Paper at this time is a drop in replacement... a large share of plugins will simply function as they always do and quite a few plugins will have a lot of improvements with chunk loading or new features not available on Spigot.

If you are confused about how to migrate, a migration guide by PaperMC Team exists:

### [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/)
The platform has been a staple as a platform for uploading resources since we started to upload our resources in 2015, it's a platform that has served resource developers well when there were no alternatives.

We now actually have alternative platforms to upload on, platforms that support multiple loaders, so it's not implied/enforced that a resource must work guaranteed on Spigot.

### [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/)
Modrinth is an egg basket platform with support for mods, texture packs, datapacks and plugins. it has support for multiple loader types which is great for wanting to expand plugins to multiple platforms.

### [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/)
Hangar is a platform for Paper only plugins created by MiniDigger and other members of the PaperMC Team, it serves as a place where Server Owners who use the PaperMC software can find plugins guaranteed to work on Paper Servers.
