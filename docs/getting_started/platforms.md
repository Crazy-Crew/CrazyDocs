## Where can I download the newest versions of X plugin?
We have a server that listens to Github, and builds on every commit.

https://ci.crazycrew.us/

We will use this for experimental changes, or quick hotfixes before publishing anywhere.

## Where are we moving our resources to?
All our resources will now be uploaded on Hangar and Modrinth, you can find links to our organizations below.

### What about CrazyVouchers being paid?
CrazyVouchers has been a free for a total of 2 years, Purchases have been disabled recently ( any prior purchase is considered a donation )

### Will you ever move back to Spigot?
1) Spigot adds a section for Paper resources.
2) Paper would have to completely disappear without a chance of recovery even through other people taking up the mantle.

### What if I don't want to use Paper?
That sucks since Paper provides a better experience for developing plugins with very useful api additions which makes it easier to add new features or improve the current state of the plugins we have, not to mention a large quantity of performance improvements and bug fixes for servers.

#### Paper Forks
Paper has it's own fork network, The most commonly used one is Purpur which contains a large quantity of fun features like flying squids.

#### Migration
If you are confused about how to migrate, a migration guide by PaperMC Team exists:

### [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/)
The platform has been a staple as a platform for uploading resources since we started to upload our resources in 2015, it's a platform that has served resource developers well when there were no alternatives.

We now actually have alternative platforms to upload on, platforms that support multiple loaders, so it's not implied/enforced that a resource must work guaranteed on Spigot.

### [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/)
Modrinth is an egg basket platform with support for mods, texture packs, datapacks and plugins. it has support for multiple loader types which is great for wanting to expand plugins to multiple platforms.

### [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/)
Hangar is a platform for Paper only plugins created by MiniDigger and other members of the PaperMC Team, it serves as a place where Server Owners who use the PaperMC software can find plugins guaranteed to work on Paper Servers.
