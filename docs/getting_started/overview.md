## Discord Support
 ### [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/badbones-s-live-chat-182615261403283459)
- If you are using CrazyCrates, go in `#crazycrates` and so on for the other plugins.
  - `CrazyAuctions`, `CrazyWarps`, `BlockParticles` are in maintenance mode or under a rewrite so previous versions are not supported and we simply don't offer support for them at this time.
